-->. Memoization Recipe:
1. Make it work:
  --First, large problem make it smaller, 
    and visualize as a tree
   --Implement the tree using recursion(either upward or downward)

    NB:How do you visualize the tree ? Here tree leaf is the base case
       of the tree. Incase, it is type of fibbonacci , then n equal 
    one or n eqaul two.Now when you have baseline recursion, that's 
    going to your bruteforce.




2. Make it efficient:
--Add a memo object
--add a base case to return memo values
--store return vlaues into the memeo

--->We will be sure to follow these rules for falling problems.
